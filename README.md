Databag is a self-hosting network for the DWeb community, implementing the IndiCom messaging service. Notable features include:
- Public-private key based identity and not bound to any blockchain or hosting domain.
- Direct communication between app and contact's node with no serverside replication.
- Data maintained in revision trees for effient data syncrhonization.
- Websockets utilized for delivering synchronization events.

You can test out the project [here](https://databag.coredb.org/#/create), but dont post anything important as the server is regularly wiped.
